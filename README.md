# Hash Stream [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stream-utils/hash-stream.png)](https://travis-ci.org/stream-utils/hash-stream)

Simple wrapper around `crypto.createHash()` for files and streams.

## API

```js
var getHash = require('hash-stream')
```

## getHash(filename || stream, algorithm, callback)

- `filename` - path of the file
- `stream` - a readable stream
- `algorithm` - any defined by `crypto.getHashes()`

Returns a `hash` as a raw `Buffer`, so if you want a hex:

```js
getHash('image.png', 'sha256', function (err, hash) {
  hash = hash.toString('hex')
})
```

## [CLI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)

You can use `nhash` to hash a file and get the output instantly. The usage options are simple:
```
$ nhash --help
Usage: nhash [options] [file]

Options:

  -h, --help              output usage information
  -V, --version           output the version number
  -a, --algorithm <sha1>  the hash alorithm
  -e, --encoding <hex>    the encoding of output
```
